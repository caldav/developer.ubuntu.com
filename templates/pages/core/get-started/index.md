# Get started

Ubuntu Core is supported on a variety of chipsets, boards, SOCs and virtual machines, including Raspberry Pi 2 and 3, Qualcomm DragonBoard 410c, Intel NUC, Intel Joule, Samsung Artik and KVM. This section will guide you through the steps of installing Ubuntu Core on these platforms.
